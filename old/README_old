RNA-seq analysis

Description
===========
The RNA_analysis package contains some scripts for making a basic RNS-seq 
analysis of a project. 

RNA_analysis.sh
analysis_report.py  
correl.R  
get_stat.sh  
make_sbatch.sh  
merge.sh 

The main script of the pipeline is RNA_analysis.sh. For help on how to use 
any of the sub scripts taken separately, run the particular script without 
arguments. 

RNA_analysis.sh should be run from the intermediate directory containing a 
sub directory with the tophat_out_* folders from Mikaels pipeline 
with cufflinks output and counts.

If the project has been resequenced RNA_analysis.sh  merges the
alignments from the different runs and reruns HTseq and cufflinks
on the merged alignments before starting the regular pipeline.
This is done with the assumption that each run is represented in 
intermediate by a separate sub directory in the following way:

Eg:

$ ls /proj/a2010002/projects/m_muurinen_11_01a/intermediate
20120127B_hiseq2000  20120228A_hiseq2000  20120321B_hiseq2000
$ ls /proj/a2010002/projects/m_muurinen_11_01a/intermediate/20120127B_hiseq2000
tophat_out_1	tophat_out_14	tophat_out_19	tophat_out_5
tophat_out_10	tophat_out_15	tophat_out_20	tophat_out_6
tophat_out_11	tophat_out_16	tophat_out_2	tophat_out_7
tophat_out_12	tophat_out_17	tophat_out_3	tophat_out_8
tophat_out_13	tophat_out_18	tophat_out_4	tophat_out_9
$ ls /proj/a2010002/projects/m_muurinen_11_01a/intermediate/20120228A_hiseq2000
tophat_out_11	tophat_out_13
$ ls /proj/a2010002/projects/m_muurinen_11_01a/intermediate/20120321B_hiseq2000
tophat_out_11   tophat_out_13


Usage of RNA_analysis.sh
========================

Step 0:
Before you start make sure that the variable WP in RNA_analysis.sh is set to the 
path where you have saved RNA_analysis package.


Step 1:
In the intermediate directory, type
$ RNA_analysis.sh <run dir> <project id> <bed file> <gtf file>

	<run dir>
                - The name of the directory with the tophat_out_* -dirs.
		This is typically the same as the run name, such as
		20120323A_hiseq2000, but can be any name. The name of
		the run dir will also be the name set as the 'run name' 
		in the report. You might want to change this in the 
		rst file if your run dir name doesn't have an appropriate
		'run name'.

                - If set to 'm' the script will merge and do the analysis on 
                the merged runs 
	<project id> 
		- eg: M.Muurinen_11_01a
	<bed file> 
		- reference gene model in bed format. Used by Ever-Seq
		to get gene body coverage and read distribution. 
	<gtf fie>
		- reference annotation in gtf format, used by cufflinks and HTseq
		- set to "-" if not merging

Output directory:
If the script was run with the merge flag "m", the output will be placed in a new 
directory called merged, otherwise it will be placed in <run date><A/B>_hiseq2000.


Step 2:
When the pipeline is finished a bash file for generating the report has been 
created and stored in the sbatch folder in the output directory. Before making the 
report you need to generate a mako template standing in the output directory.

$ sphinx-quiqstart        
$ /sbatch/analysis_report.sh
$ make latexpdf
